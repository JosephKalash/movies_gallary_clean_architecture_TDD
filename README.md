# Introduction
This project depends on Clean Architecture which is created by uncle Bob and TDD as a software development proccess which aims to test cases before begin to code them.
The Project is still under developing, but until now the app could show the popular movies with their details which is shown in separated page.
# Structure of the project
As I follow Clean Architecture for my Flutter project I have until now "movies gallary" feature and "Authantication" feature (not finish yet).
The structure for every feature is this:
